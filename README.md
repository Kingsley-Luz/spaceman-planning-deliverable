# spaceman-planning-deliverable
I will be making a spaceman game. 
The game will start off with the player clicking the play now button. 
The player will then have to guess the letters of the mystery word that is generated.
A piece of a spaceship will be built for each wrong letter that is guessed.
After seven wrong guesses, the player loses.
